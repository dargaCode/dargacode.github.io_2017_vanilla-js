My C# and MySQL projects are owned by previous employers, and are closed source.

## C# #

While working at various game companies, I built tools as windows executables in C#:

1. **Game launcher** for the Sims 2 dev team to greatly simplify generating game options. Before my app, these had always been written by hand and the process was extremely error prone.
  * Used file browsers, checkboxes, etc to generate complicated launch option strings.
  * Had the option to launch the game immediately or save out separate batch files for common configs.
1. **Folder collapser** to squash the contents of a complicated file structure down into a single folder.
1. **Template generator** to produce a large number of templated files from an example file and a list of file names.

## MySQL

While working as a game designer at Storm8, I released several mobile games with extensive databases for features and live content:

* Wrote SQL queries to gather, aggregate, and modify data.
* Helped design database schemas for new games and features.
